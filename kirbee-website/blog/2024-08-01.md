## Overview
I worked as a software engineer intern at ZK Soft Partner. This was a completely new experience for me, as I had little prior knowledge about what a software engineering career entails. Overall, it was an exciting and inspiring start to my professional journey.

## Work Responsibilities
During my internship, I was tasked with developing a testing procedure. At first, I felt frustrated because none of my co-workers were familiar with the task, so I had to figure things out on my own. I spent a lot of time reading documentation, asking senior engineers for guidance, and doing my best to complete the task. By the end of my internship, I had tested many React components and worked on end-to-end testing.

## Takeaways
Over the course of these months, I learned a great deal. I gained insight into how a company operates, what software engineers do, and the roles of different positions within the company. These questions were all answered during my internship. Additionally, I developed important computer science skills. Now, I am motivated to continue progressing academically and improve my English. I sincerely thank my co-workers who supported and taught me. I look forward to having an even better work experience in the future!
