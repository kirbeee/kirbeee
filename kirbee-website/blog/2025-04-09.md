## Introduction
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the most popular cloud service provider. Around 70% of companies choose AWS to support their products. Because of this, AWS certifications in various domains are becoming more and more popular. I also decided to take the AWS certification exam to improve my tech stack.
AWS offers hundreds of services, such as Route 53, EC2, ELB, and many more. In the SAA (Solutions Architect Associate) exam, I need to memorize most of these services and understand how to combine them to build an application. The test includes many real-world scenarios where you need to find the most appropriate solution to application problems.

## Takeaway
After taking the AWS SAA exam, I truly felt a sense of achievement. This was the first step in improving my English.
I truly believe that English is important in computer science, especially because most of the documents I read are in English. Now, I feel less afraid of reading English materials. I think this is the beginning of my journey in both English and computer science. I’ll keep my passion alive!
