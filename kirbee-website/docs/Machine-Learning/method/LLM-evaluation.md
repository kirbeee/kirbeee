## Method
- use **DataSet** to evaluate LLMs
- The **DataSet** is math problem 
- Paper: [DeepSeek-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948)

## Problem
### How many problem are LLM memory?
- Paper: [GSM-Symbolic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229)
- Paper: [Premise Order Matters in Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08939)

### If we change DataSet is it good enough?
- Paper: [ARC-AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547)

## Conclusion - Goodhart's Law
> **_"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"_**
