title: Elastic Beanstalk
---
# Elastic Beanstalk
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- It uses all the component's we've seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc...
- But it's all in one view that's easy to make sense of!
- We still have full control over the configuration
- Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS)

## Managed service
- Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk
- Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk
- Capacity provisioning
- Load balancing & auto-scaling
- Application health-monitoring & responsiveness
## Responsibility
- Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer
## Architecture
- Three architecture models:
- Single Instance deployment: good for dev
- LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
- ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc..)
# Beanstalk
- Health agent pushes metrics to CloudWatch
- Checks for app health, publishes health events
