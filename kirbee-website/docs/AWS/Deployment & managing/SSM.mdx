# How it works
![SSM](./SSM-arch.png)
- We need to install the SSM agent onto the systems we control
- Installed by default on Amazon Linux AMl & some Ubuntu AMI
- If an instance can't be controlled with SSM, it's. probably an issue with the SSM agent.
- Thanks to the SSM agent, we can run commands, patch & configure our servers
