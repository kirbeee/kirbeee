title: Storage Gateway
---
# Introduction
- AWS is pushing for "hybrid cloud"
    - Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
    - Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
- This can be due to
    - Long cloud migrations
    - Security requirements
    - Compliance requirements
    - IT strategy
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premise?

- Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
- Hybrid storage service to allow on-premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
- Types of Storage Gateway:
- File Gateway
- Volume Gateway
- Tape Gateway
- No need to know the types at the exam
