# S3 Security
## Object Encryption
- You can encrypt objects in S3 buckets using one of 4 methods
- Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
    - Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) – Enabled byDefault
        - Encrypts S3 objects using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS
    - Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
        - Leverage AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage encryption keys
    - Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
        - When you want to manage your own encryption keys
- Client-Side Encryption
- It’s important to understand which ones are for which situation for the exam

### SSE-S3
- Encryption using keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS
- Object is encrypted server-side
- Encryption type is AES-256
- Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
- Enabled by default for new buckets & new objects

### SSE-KMS
- Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- KMS advantages: user control + audit key usage using CloudTrail
- Object is encrypted server side
- Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"

#### SSE-KMS Limitation

<div className="flex items-start space-x-4">

    <ul className="w-2/3 list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700">
        <li>If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by the KMS limits.</li>
        <li>When you upload, it calls the GenerateDataKey KMS API.</li>
        <li>When you download, it calls the Decrypt KMS API.</li>
        <li>Counts toward the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region).</li>
        <li>You can request a quota increase using the Service Quotas Console.</li>
    </ul>

</div>

### SSE-C
- Server-Side Encryption using keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
- Amazon S3 does NOT store the encryption key you provide
- HTTPS must be used
- Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made
<Image alt="SSE-C"  img={require("./SSE-C.png")}/>

### Client-Side Encryption
- Use client libraries such as Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library
- Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to Amazon S3
- Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from Amazon S3
- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

## Encryption in Transit(SSL/TLS)
- Encryption in flight is also called SSL/TLS
- Amazon S3 exposes two endpoints:
    - HTTP Endpoint – non encrypted
    - HTTPS Endpoint – encryption in flight
- HTTPS is recommended
- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C
- Most clients would use the HTTPS endpoint by default

## What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Origin = scheme (protocol) + host (domain) + port
    - example: https://www.example.com (implied port is 443 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)
- Web Browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin
- Same origin: http://example.com/app1 & http://example.com/app2
- Different origins: http://www.example.com & http://other.example.com
- The requests won’t be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests, using CORS Headers (example: Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
<Image alt="CORS"  img={require("./CORS.png")}/>
- If a client makes a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers
- It’s a popular exam question
- You can allow for a specific origin or for * (all origins)
