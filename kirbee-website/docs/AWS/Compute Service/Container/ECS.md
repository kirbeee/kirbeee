# ECS (Elastic Container Service)
![ECS](./ECS.png)
- ECS = Elastic Container Service
- Launch Docker containers on AWS
- You must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
- AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers
- Has integrations with the Application Load Balancer

## Launch Types
### EC2 Launch Type
![img.png](EC2-launch-type.png)
- Launch Docker containers on AWS = Launch ECS Tasks on ECS Clusters
- EC2 Launch Type: you must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
- Each EC2 Instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
- AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers

### Fargate Launch Type
![img.png](Fargate-lunch-type.png)
- Launch Docker containers on AWS
- You do not provision the infrastructure(no EC2 instances to manage)
- It’s all Serverless!
- You just create task definitions
- AWS just runs ECS Tasks for you based on the CPU / RAM you need
- To scale, just increase the number of tasks. Simple - no more EC2 instances

## IAM Roles for ECS
- EC2 Instance Profile (EC2 Launch Type only):
    - Used by the ECS agent
    - Makes API calls to ECS service
    - Send container logs to CloudWatch Logs
    - Pull Docker image from ECR
    - Reference sensitive data in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
- ECS Task Role:
    - Allows each task to have a specific role
    - Use different roles for the different ECS Services you run
    - Task Role is defined in the task definition

## Load Balancing Integration
- Application Load Balancer supported and works for most use cases
- Network Load Balancer recommended only for high throughput / high performance use cases, or to pair it with AWS Private Link
- Classic Load Balancer supported but not recommended (no advanced features - no Fargate)

## Data Volumes
- Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks
- Works for both EC2 and Fargate launch types
- Tasks running in any AZ will share the same data in the EFS file system
- Fargate + EFS = Serverless
- Use cases: persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers
- Note:
- Amazon S3 cannot be mounted as a file system

## ECS Service Auto Scaling
- Automatically increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks
- Amazon ECS Auto Scaling uses AWS Application Auto Scaling
  - ECS Service Average CPU Utilization
  - ECS Service Average Memory Utilization - Scale on RAM
  - ALB Request Count Per Target – metric coming from the ALB
- Target Tracking – scale based on target value for a specific CloudWatch metric
- Step Scaling – scale based on a specified CloudWatch Alarm
- Scheduled Scaling – scale based on a specified date/time (predictable changes)
- ECS Service Auto Scaling (task level) ≠ EC2 Auto Scaling (EC2 instance level)
- Fargate Auto Scaling is much easier to setup (because Serverless)

### EC2 Launch Type – Auto Scaling EC2 Instances
- Accommodate ECS Service Scaling by adding underlying EC2 Instances
- Auto Scaling Group Scaling
  - Scale your ASG based on CPU Utilization
  - Add EC2 instances over time
- ECS Cluster Capacity Provider
  - Used to automatically provision and scale the infrastructure for your ECS Tasks
  - Capacity Provider paired with an Auto Scaling Group
  - Add EC2 Instances when you’re missing capacity (CPU, RAM…)
