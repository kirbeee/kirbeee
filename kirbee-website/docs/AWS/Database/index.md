# Introduction to Database
## Choosing the Right Database
- We have a lot of managed databases on AWS to choose from
- Questions to choose the right database based on your architecture:
- Read-heavy, write-heavy, or balanced workload? Throughput needs? Will it change, does it need to scale or fluctuate during the day?
- How much data to store and for how long? Will it grow? Average object size? How are they accessed?
- Data durability? Source of truth for the data ?
- Latency requirements? Concurrent users?
- Data model? How will you query the data? Joins? Structured? Semi-Structured?
- Strong schema? More flexibility? Reporting? Search? RDBMS / NoSQL?
- License costs? Switch to Cloud Native DB such as Aurora?

## Database Types
- RDBMS (= SQL / OLTP): RDS, Aurora – great for joins
- NoSQL database – no joins, no SQL : DynamoDB (~JSON), ElastiCache (key / value pairs), Neptune (graphs), DocumentDB (for MongoDB), Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)
- Object Store: S3 (for big objects) / Glacier (for backups / archives)
- Data Warehouse (= SQL Analytics / BI): Redshift (OLAP), Athena, EMR
- Search: OpenSearch (JSON) – free text, unstructured searches
- Graphs: Amazon Neptune – displays relationships between data
- Ledger: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database
- Time series: Amazon Timestream
- Note: some databases are being discussed in the Data & Analytics section
