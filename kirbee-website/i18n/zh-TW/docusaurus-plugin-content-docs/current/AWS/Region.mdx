How to choose an AWS region for your application
- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- Proximity to customers: reduced latency
- Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region
- Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
